## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ReactJS, Express, Firebase, Axios, Stripe, Moment, and Material-UI

Creating an Amazon look-a-like, I focused on Amazon's customer obsession to bring a front and backend together with the possibilty to scale and incorporate system design patterns. Using the BEM naming convention, I created efficient arrow function components and hooks for state management. You can sign up, sign in, purchase, and review past orders.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that firebase is more powerful than I previously had thought it to be as well as really useful. I also learned that no matter if things were able to work before, something will always break and my patience is never-ending.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
